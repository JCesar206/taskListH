# Task List Project Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The project compiles a list of tasks, which are temporarily stored in the PC's Local Storage.<br>
Each time a new task is added, it is added to an unordered list.<br>
It offers the option to delete completed tasks or cross them out and then delete them. Since it stores information in Local Storage, JSON is used to store the text.<br>
Additional features include animations in the document's footer. A theme (light or dark) can also be assigned, which affects the document's background.<br>
Links to social media are added to the footer.<br>
